**Project Roadmap: Conversational AI Dialer with ElevenLabs & SignalWire**

---

### üöÄ PHASE 1: REQUIREMENTS & INITIAL SETUP

**1.1 Project Objectives**
- Build a cloud-based dialer application capable of receiving inbound calls and performing batch outbound calls.
- Utilize ElevenLabs Conversational AI agents for voice interaction.
- Use SignalWire for telephony infrastructure including SIP, audio streaming, and number management.

**1.2 Team Roles**
- Project Manager
- AI/ML Engineer (Conversational AI setup)
- Backend Developer (API, logic, integrations)
- Frontend Developer (dashboard, monitoring)
- DevOps Engineer (CI/CD, deployment)

**1.3 Tech Stack Selection**
- **Backend**: Node.js or Python (FastAPI)
- **Frontend**: React.js (w/ Tailwind UI)
- **Telephony**: SignalWire SDK + SIP trunking
- **AI/Voice**: ElevenLabs Conversational AI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MySQL
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, AWS/GCP, GitHub Actions

**1.4 Accounts & Access**
- Set up ElevenLabs account and get API keys
- Set up SignalWire account, buy phone numbers
- Verify SIP trunking and outbound call capabilities

### üåê PHASE 2: CORE ARCHITECTURE DESIGN

**2.1 Application Architecture**
- Microservices layout or monolithic app w/ API layers
- SIP integration module
- Webhook server to handle SignalWire XML
- Media streaming connector to/from ElevenLabs

**2.2 Call Flow Design**
- Inbound: Call ‚Üí SignalWire ‚Üí SIP/Webhook ‚Üí ElevenLabs agent ‚Üí Response to caller
- Outbound: Scheduler ‚Üí SignalWire batch call ‚Üí SIP/media route to ElevenLabs ‚Üí Call execution

**2.3 AI Agent Design**
- Prompt engineering for dynamic agent behavior
- Agent memory/state storage (via ElevenLabs Tools)
- Agent webhook for external logic access

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è PHASE 3: IMPLEMENTATION

**3.1 Backend API Development**
- Endpoints for:
  - Start/Stop batch calls
  - Retrieve call logs
  - Manage phone lists
  - Configure ElevenLabs agent IDs
- SIP audio streaming (using WebRTC/SIP module)

**3.2 SignalWire Integration**
- Inbound call router (SignalWire XML/cXML/SWML)
- Outbound batch call scheduler (with retry/queue logic)
- Answering Machine Detection (AMD) setup
- Real-time call event listener

**3.3 ElevenLabs Agent Configuration**
- Train conversational AI agent with default and fallback prompts
- Set up system instructions and assistant character
- Enable "Tools" for webhook calling during conversation
- Configure response latency and interruptability

**3.4 Frontend Dashboard**
- Metrics view: Total calls, call durations, success/failure rates
- Logs: Inbound/outbound call records
- Voice agent selector
- Batch uploader for outbound campaigns
- **Contacts Page**:
  - UI for contact list view (React + Tailwind CSS)
  - CSV upload with validation (check for valid headers, phone number formats, duplicates)
  - Display parsing errors in UI before import
  - Store contacts in database for campaign linking

**3.5 Media Streaming & Call Bridging**
- SIP bridging between SignalWire and ElevenLabs
- Alternative: WebRTC streaming if SIP unsupported directly
- Handle session ID mapping and clean shutdowns

---

### üìä PHASE 4: TESTING & QA

**4.1 Unit & Integration Testing**
- Test webhook callbacks from SignalWire
- Validate ElevenLabs prompt/response logic
- Test SIP call audio clarity and latency

**4.2 Batch Call Simulations**
- Create sandbox call group for batch testing
- Test answer handling, agent engagement, and retries
- Verify call analytics and data accuracy

**4.3 Security Audits**
- API key protection & secrets rotation
- SIP gateway encryption
- Rate limiting, abuse protection

---

### üéì PHASE 5: DEPLOYMENT

**5.1 Infrastructure Setup**
- Dockerize backend and frontend services
- Deploy using AWS/GCP (EC2/Fargate/Cloud Run)
- Load balancing and auto-scaling (if needed)

**5.2 Domain Setup**
- Subdomain for dashboard and API
- Secure via HTTPS and DNS management

**5.3 CI/CD Pipeline**
- GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for deployments
- Linting, testing, and build stages

---

### üåü PHASE 6: MONITORING & OPTIMIZATION

**6.1 Observability Tools**
- Use Grafana + Prometheus for call metrics
- Logging: ELK Stack or Logtail

**6.2 Optimization**
- Fine-tune AI agent responses for conversion
- Adjust batch call concurrency based on carrier performance
- Retry policy optimization for failed calls

**6.3 Feedback Loops**
- Customer feedback on voice experience
- Integrate user surveys or post-call rating

---

**Estimated Timeline**: 6‚Äì8 weeks MVP ‚Üí 12 weeks for full feature set

Let me know if you want a visual flow diagram or code scaffolding for any module.

### SECURITY NOTE

**API Keys and Credentials**
- API keys, tokens, and other sensitive credentials should NOT be stored directly in code or documentation files
- Use environment variables (.env files) for local development
- Use secrets management tools for production (AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, etc.)
- Never commit credentials to version control
- Rotate API keys periodically following security best practices
